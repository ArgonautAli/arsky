- `npm start`: Run the compiled app
- `npm run dev`: Run the app in development mode with ts-node
- `npm test`: Run the test suite
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix`: Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check`: Check code formatting without making changes

### Testing

We use Jest for unit testing. Run the test suite with:

```sh
npm test
```

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting.

To run the linter:
